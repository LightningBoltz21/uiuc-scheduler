      "Introduction to writing for games. The purpose of this course is to help writers with experience in other media to understand the nuances of writing for games. Video games writers have the responsibility to incorporate the “reader”/player into the writing in ways that other media does not. They must not only incorporate story elements, but also puzzles, organizational principles, and the consideration of multiple branches and scenarios. This course will help traditional writers become more dynamic, and interactive writers will learn to hone their craft.",
