      "Study of the history and politics of American cities as sites of everyday struggles against systemic racialized exclusions rooted in patterns of residential segregation. Frame everyday racial encounters as surface symptoms of submerged and systematic forms of racism rooted in centuries of genocide, land theft, racial slavery and decades of Jim Crow segregation and neoliberal exclusions. Explore everyday racial conflicts in selected cities as expressions of historical struggles for social and spatial justice, across multiple scales. Focus on the governance of routine social practices ranging from policing, to education, to gentrification and memorialization in public places. Final student projects will focus on social struggles against systemic and everyday racisms in a self-selected city of their choice.",

What are the impacts of these decisions on the environment, the economy, social equity, congestion, public health, and safety? Will autonomous vehicles simply encourage more driving, or can they be harnessed in a way that supports wider community goals? How do we design streets that are safe for all travel modes? Through a combination of discussions, case studies, and hands-on activities, students will think critically and creatively about these questions and about the role of transportation planners in creating positive change for communities.",

      "This course will provide an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques applied in the real estate development process. In addition, this course will examine both the broader economic and social context in which real estate development is situated as well as how various professions interact within this context. Course assessments will include several case study assignments and a group project using an actual development site that will provide students with the chance to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the course, culminating in a final report and presentation. The overall objective of the course is to provide students with a useful framework for understanding the real estate development process, allowing them to identify viable development opportunities and analyze real estate development projects, while weighing the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits for a community.",
