Through this course, students will gain knowledge on fundamental quantitative genetics concepts and learn how to apply this knowledge to everyday plant breeding situations. Special attention will be given to the application of QTL discovery, population improvement, and genomic selection in plant breeding programs. Each class will consist of a combination of lecture and in-class computer exercises conducted in small groups that the instructor will coach individually.
