Readings and discussions introduce the theories upon which classroom practices are based, and follow the historical sequence of three major movements within art education over the past 100 years: self-expression in art education, discipline-based art education, and the recent shift toward visual culture in art education. Primary emphasis will be on understanding recent and contemporary orientations. Designed to provide a basis for more in-depth study of curriculum and instruction, child development, multiculturalism, visual culture, and other areas germane to art education. Students compare and contrast the literature in terms of the theories offered, or assumed, of children, art, pedagogy, and society. In addition, students will be introduced to academic standards of writing.",
