Masculinities, in its various forms, shapes and lives of both women and men and this course will examine the construction, reproduction, and impact of masculinities on the institutions of politics, education, work, religion, sports, family, media, and the military to name a few. Paying careful attention to the conjunctions between materiality and culture, this course will interrogate how masculinities shape individual lives, groups, nationalisms, organizations, and institutions and will analyze the ways in which power functions within local transnational contexts. Above all, this course offers a road map for forging new, progressive models of masculinity.",

Students will produce their own original research based on genuine gaps in existing knowledge.

Students will examine and critically evaluate historical and contemporary debates that contest normative male/female binaries and traditional categorizations of sexuality. The course moves beyond these initial inquiries into gender theory to consider the effects of institutional discourses produced through stage and civil society. Taught with particular attention given to questions of race, national formations, medical, and legal discourses. Areas of inquiry may include gender theory, transnational identities, gendered and racial performances, medical and psychological diagnoses, violence, the law, and the Prison Industrial Complex. Through these topics, students will be asked to consider important questions over political and legal representation, autonomy, the rights of citizenship, and the practice of everyday life.",
