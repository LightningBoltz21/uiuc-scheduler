      "This course concerns the emergence of \"art\" and \"cultural property\" law as a distinct field of legal inquiry and practice. Still, this subject draws from nearly the entire spectrum of traditional legal subjects – intellectual property, free speech, contracts, crime, treaties, tax, etc. Art and Cultural Property Law deals with the relationships, rights, transactions and disputes among collectors, artists (and their heirs), dealers, auction houses, museums and other art world participants (including local and foreign governments, sovereign nations and indigenous peoples, the entertainment industry, sports franchises and social media). Among the dozens of important relevant issues in this field are the successes and failures of law in policing cultural heritage crimes, the rise of artistic nationalism, cultural heritage as a casualty of war, censorship, and provenance studies.",

      "Wrongdoing is part of the history of many, if not most, political communities around the globe. This course examines the moral questions that dealing with past wrongdoing raise. Our focus is specifically on political wrongdoing, that is, wrongdoing inflicted on individuals by the state or groups contesting the state. Such wrongdoing has taken different forms, from slavery, to forced disappearances, to programs of torture and of land appropriation. We also focus on two specific political contexts: the United States and South Africa. In this course, we survey a range of legal measures including criminal punishment, truth commissions, reparations, and apology, that have been, and can be used, to deal with legacies of wrongdoing.
