This introductory course explores the intersection of consumer data and society, equipping students with the tools and knowledge necessary to navigate, analyze, and interpret data in everyday life. This is not a math course, but you will gain numeracy and understanding of data and statistics as you consider concepts, questions, and ways of thinking about data through the lens of advertising, media, politics, consumer behavior, and life. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical applications, students will develop a critical understanding of how data shapes our world and how to use data responsibly and effectively to solve consumer and business problems.",
