This introductory course explores the intersection of consumer data and society, equipping students with the tools and knowledge necessary to navigate, analyze, and interpret data in everyday life. This is not a math course, but you will gain numeracy and understanding of data and statistics as you consider concepts, questions, and ways of thinking about data through the lens of advertising, media, politics, consumer behavior, and life. Through a combination of theoretical insights and practical applications, students will develop a critical understanding of how data shapes our world and how to use data responsibly and effectively to solve consumer and business problems.",

The rotation will integrate medical and veterinary medical students around epidemiology to understand components affecting health from food safety and production to obesity to water systems at the interface of human, animal and ecosystem health. Additionally, students will work in close contact with local and state health departments, gain an understanding of the scope of activities in which local and state health departments are involved, study major and current health threats to humans, animals and the ecosystem and consider policy initiatives to address those threats. Day long field trips and one overnight trip within the state are possible.",

However, those recording technologies generate data at such scale and complexity that rigorous data analysis approaches for automatic information retrieval are required to fully leverage their potential. This course will introduce students to multiple neural data modalities (e.g., EEG and fMRI) and illustrate through examples, how modern data analysis techniques such as machine learning can be used to automatically extract meaningful information from those data. We will cover basics of neural data acquisition, preprocessing methods, data representation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and some select advanced analytic concepts. This course will put equal emphasis on the understanding of analytical methods as well as practical hands-on experience, and equip the students with the essential skills to analyze neural data using advanced data analysis techniques such as machine learning. This course is designed for junior/senior undergraduate students with no or very limited prior experience in data science. Although prior exposure to the Python programming language is preferred, it is not required.",

In this course you will develop a perspective that will allow you to analyze the social world in a way that reveals the hidden and/or overlooked social forces that shape our lives. This approach, the sociological imagination, will enable you to explore how social forces influence the ways we view and navigate our social world. We will discuss how sociologists use theory and research to better understand important social issues such as inequalities of race, class, gender, sexualities and how social order and social change are possible. We will discuss how society affects individuals and in turn how individuals can affect society.",

Theories of learning, collaborative learning, and the dynamics of the tutoring relationship will be discussed issues of working with specific writers such as English Language Learners will be explored. A relevant issue of interest will become the topic for an extended research paper. As theory is applied to practice, students will write, share their writing with others, and observe and participate in writing tutoring session. Later in the semester students will consult with writers, either with an experienced consultant or alone. Satisfactory completion of all requirements of the class and approval of the Writers Workshop Director will allow students to consult in the Writers Workshop the following semester.",
